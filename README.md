## Why?

Financial analysts, and other non-coding working professionals need a basic desktop application to test multiple AI model providers on large batches of their own questions. Currently no easy application for this exists.

Doing this requires writing code, which is not a viable option for a lot of professionals. Eye on the Benchmarks exists for such professionals who have ideas about how to test AI models at using actual business PDFs and optional access to live sources on the internet to answer tough questions.
