Eye on the Benchmarks lets you use AI with the simplest possible setup so you can better understand its strengths and weaknesses.

## Prompts and Models and APIs

You run one or more prompts at a time and get responses from one or more models. The application makes API calls behind the scenes to different model providers and records the response from each model (as well as the cost + latency of every request).

### Models

    - GPT 4.1 + mini + nano
